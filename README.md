# SeekMyDocs

**SeekMyDocs** is an offline, privacy-first document search engine for Android. It indexes documents already on your device — PDFs, Office files, text, and more — and lets you find them instantly with filename, keyword, OCR, or on-device semantic search. No document content ever needs to leave the device to be searchable.

> Built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and on-device ML (TensorFlow Lite).

## Features

- **Automatic background indexing** of documents on external storage (Downloads, Documents, MediaStore) via WorkManager, running every ~4 hours under battery/idle constraints
- **Real-time re-indexing** while the app is open, using a `ContentObserver` on the MediaStore
- **Incremental indexing** — files are re-indexed only when their name/size/modified-time hash changes
- **Hybrid search** combining:
  - Filename matching
  - Keyword / full-text search over extracted content
  - OCR text search (for scanned PDFs/images)
  - On-device semantic (vector) search using cosine similarity over chunk embeddings from a local Gemma embedding model
- **Ranked results** using a weighted score combining relevance, recency, and how often a document has been opened
- **Sandbox/demo mode** that generates sample documents (resume, bill, timetable, etc.) so search can be tried without real files
- **Open/share documents** directly from search results via a `FileProvider`
- **Dashboard** showing indexing stats: documents indexed, chunks, embeddings generated, OCR pages cached, storage used, last sync time
- **Settings** to toggle auto-indexing, OCR, semantic search, embedding engine, and dark mode

### Supported document formats

PDF, DOC/DOCX, XLS/XLSX, PPT/PPTX, TXT, CSV, MD, JSON, XML, EPUB, ODT/ODS/ODP

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (recent stable version) or a command-line Gradle/JDK 17 setup
- **Gradle 9.3.1+** — required by AGP 9.1.1. The committed Gradle wrapper (`gradlew`/`gradlew.bat`) will download it automatically on first run
- A physical device or emulator running **Android 7.0 (API 24)** or higher

### Setup

1. Clone the repository and open it in Android Studio (or run `./gradlew installDebug` from the command line).
2. Let Android Studio sync Gradle and resolve any suggested fixes.
3. For debug builds, Android Studio will generate/use a local `debug.keystore` automatically. If building from the command line, generate one at the project root:
   ```
   keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey \
     -storepass android -keypass android -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 \
     -dname "CN=Android Debug,O=Android,C=US"
   ```
4. Run the app on an emulator or physical device.

On first launch, the app downloads a Gemma embedding model (and tokenizer) from Hugging Face to enable semantic search — an internet connection is required at least once for this.

### Permissions

The app requests:
- `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` / `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` — to scan documents across device storage
- `INTERNET` / `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` — to download the embedding model

## Building a Release

Release builds are signed using a keystore referenced by environment variables in `app/build.gradle.kts`:

- `KEYSTORE_PATH` (defaults to `${rootDir}/my-upload-key.jks`)
- `STORE_PASSWORD`
- `KEY_PASSWORD`

Supply your own keystore and credentials before building a release APK/AAB — none are committed to the repository.

## Known Limitations

- **OCR is currently stubbed**: `LocalOcrEngine` returns simulated placeholder text rather than performing real text recognition.
- No CI configuration or LICENSE file is currently included in the repository.

## License

No license has been specified for this project yet.
